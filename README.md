# Content-Aware-Image-Resizing

Better known as Seam Carving is the method of resizing an image on the basis of its content and not dimensions. 

This is a much better and holistic approach that does not lead to distorted images. 

This program is created using MATLAB. 

A succinct way to run the program will be described soon.
